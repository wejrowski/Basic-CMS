## Basic CMS

### Page setup
One of the main components is the Page. You can have different page types (much like Wordpress) and separate them out in the backend.


### Bugs

*Migration problems*

When i'm running rake:db:migrate it gave me an error

An error has occurred, all later migrations canceled:
Mysql2::Error: Table 'admin_users' already exists: CREATE TABLE `admin_users...

If encountering that bug, comment out this line in models/admin_user.rb

  #after_create { |admin| admin.send_reset_password_instructions }
