## Basic CMS

This is a bare-bones CMS setup for a websites. Use it as a starting point for websites where you want a CMS to edit page content with custom templates. Features:

* Create pages, and subpages with corresponding trailing urls
* Add custom meta info to pages
* Add custom page templates
* Add custom meta data and javascript to pages.
* Options to show in the navigation
* Add public files to the website (pdfs, images etc.)
* Easily add images to page content with tinyMCE (may currently be buggy. I have a working version of this elsewhere I need to tweak and add here.)


*In the works*

* I currently have a number of helper methods in application_helper that need to be implemented as examples. The code is written, I just need to clean it up and add it to the repo. 
* I also will be switching the views over to haml and creating a basic layout that showcases the features.
